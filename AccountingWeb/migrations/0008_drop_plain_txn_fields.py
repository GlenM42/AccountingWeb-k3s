#    copy plaintext into *_ct/_iv by calling your app encryptor. Because
#    running Python functions from SQL isnâ€™t possible, we do a small, safe
#    best-effort SQL backfill only for rows that ALREADY have ciphertext.
#    If you still have plaintext needing encryption, run your Python helper
#    before this migration (see note below).
